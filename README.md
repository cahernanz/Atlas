### How to

- install Node and npm
- Clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run start` for starting the application
- run `npm run dist` to build and create the installable
- add a `.gitignore` file to avoid git to add the `node_modules` and `app/node_modules`, `app/src/node_modules` should instead be excluded from the gitignore, e.g.
  - `.gitignore`:
                 node_modules
        !/app/src/node_modules
